      Hello everyone! My name is Shivam Vyas, and I’m 25 years old. I work as a
      Senior Software Engineer and live in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. I’ve
      been part of the software industry for over three years, with a primary
      focus on backend development.

    <section>
      I specialize in Java and Spring Boot, where I design and develop RESTful
      APIs and backend applications to meet the requirements. In my free time, I
      enjoy creating personal projects that allow me to apply and enhance my
      technical knowledge. Currently, I am also learning frontend development
      and improving my skills in data structures and algorithms to become a more
      well-rounded developer.

      I love listening to music from various genres, especially Hindi, English,
      Punjabi, and sometimes Phonk as well.
