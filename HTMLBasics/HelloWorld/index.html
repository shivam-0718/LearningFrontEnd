            Hello everyone! My name is Shivam Vyas, and I’m 25 years old. I work as a Senior Software Engineer and live in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. I’ve been part of the software industry for over three years, with a primary focus on backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in Java and Spring Boot, where I design and develop RESTful APIs and backend applications to meet the requirements. In my free time, I enjoy creating personal projects that allow me to apply and enhance my technical knowledge. 
            
            Currently, I am also learning frontend development and improving my skills in data structures and algorithms to become a more well-rounded developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love listening to music from various genres, especially Hindi, English, Punjabi, and sometimes Phonk as well.
        </p>
